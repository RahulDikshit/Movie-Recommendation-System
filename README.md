# Movie-Recommendation-System
I worked with the TMDB dataset for recommendation system research. I performed feature engineering to extract relevant features from the data. I then used ML algorithms to train models on the data and evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall. Finally, I was able to deploy the recommendation model on a web-based platform.
